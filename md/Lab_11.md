Using Mail plugin
-----------------

In this lab, we will use Mail activities. To check whether the Mail package is installed
or not, simply search for `Mail` in the **`Activities`**
panel. It will list all the mail activities. If the activities are not
listed in the **`Activities`** panel then you have to install
the `UiPath.Mail.Activities` package.

To install the Mail NuGet package, click on the **`Manage Package`**
icon at the top of the **`Activity`** panel. The **`Manage Packages`**
window will appear. Search for `mail` in the search bar. As
shown in the following screenshot, there is an **`Uninstall`** button
next to **`UiPath.Mail.Activities`**. This is because the Mail activity is already installed in UiPath Studio. If
it is not installed, an **`Install`** button will appear next to the
**`UiPath.Mail.Activities`**:
